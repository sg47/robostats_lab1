\section{Future Work}

One obvious extension to our approach would be to use the laser range return model from Probabilistic Robotics.
In Section \ref{sec:sensor_model}, we only modeled $P_\text{hit}$.
This should be extended to include models for dynamic obstacles, random noise, and max range sensor failures.
